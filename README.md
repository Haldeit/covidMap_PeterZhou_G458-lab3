### This projects contains two thematic maps that shows the intensity of the Covid-19 outbreak that took place in 2020 across the United States
### The first thematic map is a proportional symbol map. This map shows the absolute, total cases in each county with interactive bubbles that contains the state, county, and the number of total recorded cases. Here's a snapshot:

### The second thematic map is a choropleth map. This map fills the county polygon with color based on the intensity. The intensity is defined as rate, or the number of cases per 1000 residents. This compares the number of cases in respect to the population. For example, Los Angles may have the highest total number of cases, in respect to its population however it is not near the highest, which is in Colorado.
